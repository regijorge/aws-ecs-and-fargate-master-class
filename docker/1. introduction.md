    * Find base images for many technologies and OS
      * Ubuntu
      * MySql
      * Nodejs, JAVA...
* Private repository

## Docker vs Virtual Machine
* Docker is "kind of" a virtualization technology, but not quite, it's a container technology
* Resources are shared with the host => many containers on one server
